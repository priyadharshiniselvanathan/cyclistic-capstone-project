Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis Capstone

This project is part of a capstone case study focused on analyzing the riding behavior of customers using the Cyclistic bike-share program in Chicago. The goal is to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** use Cyclistic bikes differently, and recommend marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.

Project Objective

   **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

   By exploring 3 months of real-world trip data, we aim to generate insights that can guide Cyclistic’s marketing strategy.

Data Used

- Trip data from April, May, and June 2020
- Dataset includes over **200,000+ ride records**
- Each record includes:
  - Ride ID, rider type, bike type
  - Start and end time
  - Station locations
  - Ride duration

Tools and Skills Used

- **Microsoft Excel**  
  - Data cleaning
  - Adding `ride_length`, `day_of_week`, `day_name`
  - Pivot tables for analysis
  - Charts for visualization

- **GitHub**  
  - Project hosting and version control

Key Insights

- **Casual riders** had longer ride durations on average than members
- **Members** rode more consistently across all weekdays
- **Casual riders** were more active during weekends

 Recommendations
